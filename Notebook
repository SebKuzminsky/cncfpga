	programmer for TPI is included in the package, boards available online

To Do:

- figure out if all the unconnected pins on the FPGA match the Pluto-P

- verify pin configuration seems to match the data in:

- results of physical inspection of pluto-p board

    22 ohm series resistors on 7 pins between FPGA and 10 pin header, including
Q
	pins 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 93

	** these are din_1 through din_7 .. makes sense?

	**DONE**

    pin 50 has an LED and 1k resistor

	** my current design has 330 ohms

	**NOT DONE .. CAN CHANGE IF NEEDED AFTER PCB FAB**

    10k from pin 25 to pin 44, cap from pin 44 to ground

	44 is VCCIO, 25 is nSTATUS, so this is a pull-up on nSTATUS

	**DONE**

    db25 pin 11 to sole pin side of one "1L" transistor, one lead to ground, 
    4.7k from remaining lead to pin 87, another 4.7k between pins 87 and 90

	db25 pin 11 is nWait .. so it looks like nWait is being driven by
	a transistor from the FPGA DEV_CLRn output, not directly

	**DONE**

    db25 pin 12 to sole pin side of one "1L" transistor, one lead to ground,
    4.7k from remaining lead to pin 6

	db25 pin 12 is undocumented?
	so FPGA pin 6 is able to drive that pin through a transistor

	**DONE**

    why not treat all the parallel port input pins with transistors?

	http://emergent.unpythonic.net/01165081407 has an answer, that they
	are used as inverters because the FPGA has weak pull-ups on those
	pins yet those pins need to be driven low or the PC can't configure
	the FPGA by "printing to it" .. apparently that only applies to the
	two pins that have the inverters on them.

	Duh.  Of course they're inverting... how'd I miss that?

	**DONE**

    pin 49 hooked to pin 51 .. nCONFIG driven by nConfig

	**DONE**

    osc pin 3 to pin 91

	consistent with my design, 40mhz to FPGA
	**DONE**

    26 pin header pins 11 and 12 to sole pin side of "G1" transistor, both other
    leads have caps to ground

	if it's an NPN transistor:
		emitter attached to VCCINT
		base and collector both to VCCIO
		VCCIO is driven by 3.3V regulator, VCCINT is not

    4.7k between pins 87 and 90

	pin 87 is DEV_CLRn driving nWait to the PC

	**DONE**

- studying design on the way home from POSSCON 2013, hoping to figure out
  what the problem is between the parallel port and the FPGA that is causing
  configuration to fail.

  Something seems odd between the docs and what I think I found during 
  physical inspection of the pluto-p board.

  I have nWrite on pin 75, while the KNJN document says nWrite is parallel
  port pin 1 and that should be on FPGA pin 90.  The pluto_servo.pin file in
  the EMC2 pluto-p driver directory seems to say that pin 75 is a bidir DCLK
  signale, and pin 90 is an nWrite *input*.  The parallel port doc says that
  pin 1 is nStrobe in SPP mode and nWrite in EPP mode.  In both cases, that
  seems like a signal from the PC to the FPGA (strobing data in).  Reading
  the verilog source, nWrite is indeed an input to the FPGA and is used to
  determine the EPP mode.

  The pluto_servo.pin file says that pin 87 is nWait which is an output from
  the FPGA.  Everything seems consistent in suggesting this should be driving
  pin 11 on the parallel port through a transistor inverter.

  I cannot fathom why pin 87 should have a 4.7k to pin 90.

  I'm not at all sure how I ended up with pin 75 (DCLK) connected to parallel
  port pin 1.

  SO...

	- I think FPGA pin 75 should not be part of the nWrite net.
	- I think FPGA pin 90 needs to be part of the nWrite net.
	- maybe try removing R23 which is the 4.7k between FPGA pins 87 and 90,
	  and/or figure out what I was counting wrong!

- put the pluto-p under the microscope .. and low and behold, pin 75 and pin 90
  on the FPGA are *both* connected to parallel port pin 1!
