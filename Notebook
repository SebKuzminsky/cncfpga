	programmer for TPI is included in the package, boards available online

To Do:

- figure out if all the unconnected pins on the FPGA match the Pluto-P

- verify pin configuration seems to match the data in:
  ~/src/emc2-dev/src/hal/drivers/pluto_servo_firmware/pluto_servo.pin

- results of physical inspection of pluto-p board

    22 ohm series resistors on 7 pins between FPGA and 10 pin header, including
	pins 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 93

	** these are din_1 through din_7 .. makes sense?

	**DONE**

    pin 50 has an LED and 1k resistor

	** my current design has 330 ohms

	**NOT DONE .. CAN CHANGE IF NEEDED AFTER PCB FAB**

    10k from pin 25 to pin 44, cap from pin 44 to ground

	44 is VCCIO, 25 is nSTATUS, so this is a pull-up on nSTATUS

	**DONE**

    db25 pin 11 to sole pin side of one "1L" transistor, one lead to ground, 
    4.7k from remaining lead to pin 87, another 4.7k between pins 87 and 90

	db25 pin 11 is nWait .. so it looks like nWait is being driven by
	a transistor from the FPGA DEV_CLRn output, not directly

	**DONE**

    db25 pin 12 to sole pin side of one "1L" transistor, one lead to ground,
    4.7k from remaining lead to pin 6

	db25 pin 12 is undocumented?
	so FPGA pin 6 is able to drive that pin through a transistor

	**DONE**

    why not treat all the parallel port input pins with transistors?

	http://emergent.unpythonic.net/01165081407 has an answer, that they
	are used as inverters because the FPGA has weak pull-ups on those
	pins yet those pins need to be driven low or the PC can't configure
	the FPGA by "printing to it" .. apparently that only applies to the
	two pins that have the inverters on them.

	Duh.  Of course they're inverting... how'd I miss that?

	**DONE**

    pin 49 hooked to pin 51 .. nCONFIG driven by nConfig

	**DONE**

    osc pin 3 to pin 91

	consistent with my design, 40mhz to FPGA
	**DONE**

    26 pin header pins 11 and 12 to sole pin side of "G1" transistor, both other
    leads have caps to ground

	if it's an NPN transistor:
		emitter attached to VCCINT
		base and collector both to VCCIO
		VCCIO is driven by 3.3V regulator, VCCINT is not

    4.7k between pins 87 and 90

	pin 87 is DEV_CLRn driving nWait to the PC

	**DONE**
